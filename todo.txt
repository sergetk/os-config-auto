Remaining
1) create unit tests
2) logging / error handling
3) create interactive menu so I can select which parts of the script should be ran.
4) update README.md

Bugs
1) If state fails it doesn't terminate app which it should probably do, since in some cases if all actions in the
   script fail then state enters infinite loop


Daily
1) move replace with sed into command which takes regex and path of file on which to run replace 
2) create Error_state which will terminate the script
3) make sure app running with logging into log file as default
